Mission Control enables you to administer your Gravity SaaS application
from one centralised dashboard. Here you can: manage accounts and users, 
view metrics, track events, collect feedback and view error logs.

# Requirements

Before you can use Mission Control you should set up your main Gravity
application. Mission Control will plug into your existing API endpoints
and database.

## 1. Install Packages

First, ensure your main application is set up and running, then run
the following command in your terminal.

npm run setup

## 2. Setup Wizard

After you have completed the setup process, open a new browser
window and navigate to:

http://localhost:5002/setup 

Then follow the instructions in the setup wizard to complete the
setup process. When you're finished please remove all references
to the setup files in yoru code base.

### 3. Cleanup

You MUST remove the setup files from your install after setup. 
Failing to do so, will let anyone access the setup process.

npm run cleanup
